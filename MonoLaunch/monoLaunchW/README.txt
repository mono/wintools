========================================================================


AppWizard has created this monoLaunchW application for you.  

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your monoLaunchW application.

monoLaunchW.cpp
    This is the main application source file.

monoLaunchW.dsp
    This file (the project file) contains information at the project level and
    is used to build a single project or subproject. Other users can share the
    project (.dsp) file, but they should export the makefiles locally.
