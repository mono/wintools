General Description

The Visual Studio Prj2Make# add-in is meant to complement the Mono Combined
Win32 Installer.  This add in should simplify the use of Visual Studio .NET 2003
as a development platform for Mono applications and may ease the deployment of 
the developer's solution to other non-Windows platforms supported by Mono.

As stated above, the monoaddin Add-in is closely linked and dependent of the 
Mono Combined Win32 Installer.

New in this Release:

The "Test In Mono" menu option is now implemented.  This will give users the
ability to run the currently selected Startup project in a Visual Studio Solution
using the Mono Runtime that is selected in accordance with MonoLaunch.


Requirements:

- Visual Studio 2005

- Mono Combined Win32 Installer (mono-1.1.10-gtksharp-2.4.0-win32-x.x.exe or higher)

- Mono Runtime Selector Win32 Installer (MonoLaunch-1.0.0.2-1.exe or higher)
